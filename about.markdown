Serious play describes the act of pursuing serious topics playfully. Scot Osterweil's [Four Freedoms of Play](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feRw29g5yWA), for example, provide one perspective on how an attitude of playfulness and not taking oneself too seriously can promote motivation and flow, even on the challenges that matter most.

Spinning plates is a reference to [one of the classic Richard Feynman stories](https://www.physics.ohio-state.edu/~kilcup/262/feynman.html) in which Richard Feynman becomes burned out after accomplishing so much in physics, then rediscovers what it's like to enjoy physics by delighting playfully in solving a seemingly-unimportant physics problem.

This is my personal website. Here, I write about topics that feel like spinning plates and serious play to me: whatever inspires curiosity and investigation.
