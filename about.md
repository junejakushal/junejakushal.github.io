# Welcome!

This is the personal website of Kushal Juneja. Here, I write about topics that feel like spinning plates to me: whatever inspires curiosity and investigation.

# About Me 

I am currently studying Business Management at XLRI, Jamshedpur. I am interested in the domains of Technology and Finance. 

Previously, I was an Analyst with Goldman Sachs working with their Global Compliance and Engineering division. I did my Computer Science education from IIIT-Delhi where my thesis project was at the intersection of Climate Science and Deep Learning. 

I aspire to be polymath and have varied interests across linguistics, finance and technology. I’m currently learning about Agentic AI and building scalable distributed systems. To this I actively listen to the Acquired Podcast and talk on YC Root Access. I am also interested in Finance and am an avid reader of the Economist and the Financial Times. I also regularly read Indian business dailies and read articles on MoneyControl with the goal to form opinions of my own on global events and their impacts. I am also looking to explore the domain of sustainability and have started doing live projects in collaboration with XLRI in this area. I also enjoy doing skateboarding and am trying to be more regular and consistent at the gym to improve my health. I am also working towards improving my French and German. To this I am preparing for the DELF-DALF certifications and like to read and listen to world events in these languages.
