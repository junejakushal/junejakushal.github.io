# 2025: A year in review

With this post I would like to jot down my thoughts about the most volatile year till date for me, and looking at the news and events that unfolded around, for the global economy as well.


The year started with me being in Delhi and ended with me being in Delhi. In the middle, I:

- Gave the XAT entrance exam
- Got rejected by FMS and the top IIMs of India due to poor CAT 2024 performance
- Gave interviews for MBA program at XLRI, IIT D, IIT B and the IIM-CAPs. Converted all of them.
- Left my job with Goldman Sachs to pursue MBA education at XLRI
- Sat for internships at XLRI Jamshedpur, getting rejected by many companies and getting selected into 1.
- Visited and stayed in a village.
- Went for an adventure
- Ruined my health.
- Registered for 1 more exam - CFA 
- Met smart people from all across India (and for a change, from non-engg background)
- Explored Delhi, Bangalore, Mumbai, Ranchi and Jamshedpur.
- Donated blood (and did not faint this time)
- Almost got kicked out of my flat in BLR
