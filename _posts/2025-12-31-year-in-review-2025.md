With this post I would like to jot down my thoughts about the most volatile year till date for me, and looking at the news and events that unfolded around, for the global economy as well.


The year started with me being in Delhi and ended with me being in Delhi. In the middle, I pivoted and transformed my career, education and life trajectory.

In the month of Jan, 2025, I appeared for the XAT entrance examination. Funny that the night before the exam, I was hanging out with my peers at Connaught Place in Delhi. 

In the months of Feb, March and April. I appeared for multiple interviews to take admission in the premier B-schools of India. Finally, decided to join XLRI Jamshedpur in their 2 year Business Management program.

To a firm that many people aspire to work with, I left my job with Goldman Sachs to pursue my higher education goals.

At XLRI, I met smart people from all across India and from various professional and educational backgrounds. Went to a trip in a village and an adventure trip with these people.

While all of this was going on, I explored various cities such as Delhi, Bangalore, Mumbai, Ranchi and Jamshedpur.

Here is to a 2026 with the goals of improving one’s health, and going in with a mindset of growing and learning always.
